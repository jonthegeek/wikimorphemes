## Working on wikimorphemes

If you are going to work on this package, please let us know, and weâ€™ll
get you a copy of the cache currently used by the package. We are
working on making it easier to share that cache, and to make the tests
work both with and without the cache, but for now the package expects
you to have a cache available.
